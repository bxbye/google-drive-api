# How to use google drive api
Firstly, we need to get authorized by google with google account. We must create client_id from google cloud service. We will be able to download credentials.json file after create client_id. We should run a quickstart app with SCOPE variable. Google will authorize us to allow this SCOPE. After that we will be able to work on google drive. After authorization google will send us token.json file. We are going to use this file to work on google drive.
